Abstract: 

Reliable aerodynamic and aeroelastic simulations of advanced aeronautical/mechanical systems
require to predict flow-induced forces as accurately as possible. Nowadays computational fluid
dynamic techniques are quite popular, but at an overwhelming computational cost. Consequently,
methods like the unsteady vortex-lattice method (UVLM), became the workhorse for many
simulation environments. Then, numerous UVLM-based codes using diverse numerical schemes,
enhanced by several add-ons and implemented following different programming paradigms,
are available in the literature. However, there is no set of benchmark cases intended for the
systematic verification of those codes relying on the UVLM. 
Therefore, we provide six fully-reproducible benchmark cases that can be used for such an end. 
We also describe two in-house UVLM-based codes well-suited for aerodynamic simulations 
and for being encapsulated as an aerodynamic engine within partitioned aeroelastic simulation schemes. 
Since both codes follow radically different implementation philosophies, 
these represent excellent candidates to undergo the series of benchmark cases proposed. 
The work is completed by providing a valuable data set and comparison criteria to measure 
to what extent two or more codes are in agreement. Along this path, we use for very first time a 
comparison strategy to contrast free-wake methods based on the Hausdorff distance.
